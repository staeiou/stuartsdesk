Code for powering a raspberry pi display I have on my desk, which has its own Twitter account. You send a direct message to the dedicated Twitter account (which is only set up to accept DMs from my usual account) to set the status. And then the button sends a message that someone wants an update from that dedicated account to my account.

I learned flask from [this tutorial](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog) and this code is a heavily modified fork of the code from that, which is copyright (c) 2012, Miguel Grinberg. Released under an MIT-compatible license.
